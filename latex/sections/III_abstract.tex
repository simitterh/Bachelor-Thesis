In this thesis I study a two period consumption and savings problem of an expected power-utility maximizing agent. In order to determine the optimum of the total expected utility, fundamentals of portfolio management and asset pricing are applied. I discuss the effects of a proportional change in returns, as well as a mean preserving spread on the optimal investment strategy. Also, the connection between the price of the investment and the central asset pricing formula is established. In order to simplify the analysis of the problem, I create a corresponding visualization using R-Shiny, which I also describe.\\
