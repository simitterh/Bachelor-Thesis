# Optimal Investment-Consumption Decision

This repository contains all files related to my Bachelor thesis titled  
**"Portfolio Choice: Optimal Investment-Consumption Decision"**  
submitted at TU Wien, Faculty of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, in May 2022.

## Overview

In this thesis, I analyze a two-period consumption and investment decision problem faced by a risk-averse agent maximizing expected utility. The model incorporates both risky and riskless assets and explores optimal strategies using the isoelastic utility framework.

## Contents

- `Bachelor_Thesis_Portfolio_Choice_Optimal_Investment_Consumption_Decision.pdf`  
  The final version of the thesis document.

- `R-Code/`  
  R scripts for simulating and visualizing the optimal investment-consumption decision using a Shiny app.

- `LaTeX/`  
  LaTeX source files used to typeset the thesis.

## Highlights

- Analytical derivations of optimal strategies under various assumptions (e.g., price changes, mean-preserving spreads).
- Implementation of interactive visualizations in **R Shiny** to simulate different investment scenarios.
- Link to asset pricing theory through the stochastic discount factor and marginal utility.

## How to Use

To run the interactive R Shiny app:

1. Install required packages (e.g., `shiny`, `ggplot2`, etc.).
2. Open the `app.R` file located in the `R-Code/` folder.
3. Run the app in RStudio.
